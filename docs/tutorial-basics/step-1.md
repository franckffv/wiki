# Step 1: SetUp server

## Add DNS entry

Now you have to add a DNS entry for your newly created machine. you can fine the the IP address of the machine in the Hetzner server page.

We need to add A record and a CNAME record.

A XX.XX.XX.XX yourdomain.com
CNAME * yourdomain.com

For example this is how my sample entry looks like

Record Host Value A youtube1 95.217.191.119 CNAME * youtube1.antosubash.com

This might take some time to reflect so wait for a while to verify it.
Verify DNS entry

To verify dns entry we will use a tool called dig.

you can find it here `https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#A`

Make sure your domain is pointing to your ip and your subdomain is pointing to your domain

yourdomain.com -> XX.XX.XX.XX subdomain.yourdomain.com -> XX.XX.XX.XX

So both your domain and subdomain should point to the same IP Which is the IP of the machine we just created.

## Install docker and docker-compose
Follow the instructions on the official website to install docker and docker-compose on your machine.
Install Docker Engine on Debian : https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/

# For debian 11 in 2023
Uninstall old docker version 
```bash
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
```

## Set up the repository

Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

```bash
 sudo apt-get update

 sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg
```

**Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:**

```bash
 sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings

 curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

 sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

**Use the following command to set up the repository:**
```bash
    echo \
      "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
      "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
      sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

## Install Docker Engine

This procedure works for Debian on x86_64 / amd64, armhf, arm64, and Raspbian.

Update the apt package index:

```bash
 sudo apt-get update
```

Install Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose.
Latest
Specific version


To install the latest version, run:

```bash
 sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

Verify that the Docker Engine installation is successful by running the hello-world image:

```bash
 sudo docker run hello-world
```

This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints a confirmation message and exits.
